I removed all the menubars from each scene and added a main taskbar to the EdenScene class. The same was done for the statusbar. Currently working on minimizing code, and making it a little easier to read.

Changed the EdenDesktop class up quite a bit, made an EdenDesktopPane class that holds all the DesktopPane and InternalWindow logic. Still dealing with windows not being sized correctly, introduced a Text-to-Speech solution for Eden.

Working on EdenMessaging and the EdenInstantMessaging Tab. Currently creating "facebook/iOS" messenger style interface for the Instant Messaging Tab. Styles haven't been added yet, but sooner or later I want to create 2 CSS files (Light/Dark) for Eden themes that take care of every custom/offical node that's being used in the project. The EdenSettingsScene and EdenNews scene were given WIP labels so that they have some type of content to show.
