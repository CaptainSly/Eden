I removed all the menubars from each scene and added a main taskbar to the EdenScene class. The same was done for the statusbar. Currently working on minimizing code, and making it a little easier to read.

Changed the EdenDesktop class up quite a bit, made an EdenDesktopPane class that holds all the DesktopPane and InternalWindow logic. Still dealing with windows not being sized correctly, introduced a Text-to-Speech solution for Eden.
